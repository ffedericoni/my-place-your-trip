You should create visual flow diagrams for each of these journeys.  Tools like Miro, Lucidchart, or even PowerPoint can be used.  Here's a *simplified* example for the "Listing Your Place" flow:

```
[Start] --> [Click "List Your Place"] --> [Step 1: Location] --> [Step 2: Photos] --> [Step 3: Details] --> [Step 4: Amenities] --> [Step 5: Description] --> [Step 6: Availability] --> [Step 7: House Rules] --> [Step 8: Cancellation Policy] --> [Step 9: Preview] --> [Step 10: Publish] --> [Confirmation] --> [Back to Dashboard]
```

**Key Considerations for the App Flow:**

*   **Mobile Optimization:** Design with mobile users in mind.  Use responsive design principles to ensure the website looks and works well on all devices.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Don't overwhelm users with too much information at once.  Show only the most relevant information and provide options to drill down for more details.
*   **User Testing:**  Test the app flow with real users to identify and address usability issues.
*   **Iterative Development:**  Don't try to build everything at once.  Focus on the core features first and then add more features based on user feedback and business priorities.

This comprehensive app flow provides a solid foundation for building MyPlaceUrTrip. Remember to tailor it to your specific needs and constantly iterate based on user feedback.
